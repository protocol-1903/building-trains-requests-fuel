Placing a train requests it to be filled with fuel. Trains that request fuel will wait to automatically move until the requests are filled.

# Settings
- Fuel item to be requested
- Number of stacks to request (set to 0 to disable mod)
- Override preexisting fuel requests from blueprints or other mods
